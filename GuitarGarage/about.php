                <h2>About Guitar Garage</h2>
                <p>Guitar Garage was founded in the early 1920s and now distribute for top agencies like Lag Guitars, Jim Dunlop, Zoom, Deering Banjos, SX Guitars and many more across Ireland. We also produce Irish Tin Whistles, Bodhrans, Harps and publish
                    our own Irish music books and DVD tutors. We have a major music store at Blanchardstown Retail Park, which have recently been renovated to allow for a wider choice. In 2005, we launched one of Ireland's largest online music stores
                    where you can buy books, guitars and even pianos online! Our original Georges St. shop was a key location for the Oscar-winning Irish film 'Once'. And the Oscar ceremony used the theme of the hanging guitars from the shop in their
                    stage set for the award-winning song.
